                Hello, I am currently a fourth year student studying computer science at the University of Windsor. 
                I enjoy walking on trails, reading books, and learning weird but interesting thing.
            </p>

                I previously worked as a Junior Digital Marketing Strategist, where my main job was to understand 
                which factors caused certain ads to succeed, and which factor caused it to fail. <br/>
                I am current working as a Business Intelligence Analyst. Where I use data to produce finance or market intelligence 
                reports.
