                Let me tell you three facts about myself. I love a good story, learning, and solving problems. If you deduced that I 
                enjoy video games, you would be right, but you would be surprised at how well my interests align with my career.
            </p>

            <p id="about-body">
                I have been a Business Intelligence Analyst for 16 months and in that time, I learned an array of skills but most 
                importantly I discovered that data can tell a story, and then learned how to uncover that story. As a BI analyst my 
                main job was to help my stakeholders see the story. To do that, I transformed the data and made it more digestible and 
                accessible.

            <p id="about-body">
                I am passionate about all things related to tech, so involving myself in these topics never gets tiring for me. 
                My time in university helped me understand the importance of immersive learning, which in my case is starting a new 
                software development project. It is a great way to improve my abilities and get hands-on experience with new technologies. 
                As any developer would tell you, unexpected problems will always arise when working on a project, and I use this as an 
                opportunity to apply my problem-solving skills.
